# Mercedez-Benz-Kaggle-Competition

      This repository includes my submission for the Mercedez Benz Greener Manufacturing competition hosted by Kaggle. [https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing] . In this competition, Kagglers tackled the curse of dimensionality to reduce the time that cars spent on the test bench. Competitors worked with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms contributed to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards. My submission was ranked among Top 31%.
